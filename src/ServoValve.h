/*
	ServoValve library
	Represents one servo-controlled pneumatic valve with three states (low, high and neutral).
	It manages the servo angle based on logical input and current time.
	It takes care of the hysteresis / undershoot issue caused by friction in the valve which prevents the servo from fully reaching the goal angle.
	This is handled by overshooting the goal angle by a predefined angle (usually 2 deg) and after a predefined time (usually 200 ms) it reverts to the actual goal angle.
	After this the servo is more or less exactly at the goal angle and the motor is turned off.
	This approach greatly reduces the current consumption in idle.
