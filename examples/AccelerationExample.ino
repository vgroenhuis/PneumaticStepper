/*
 * This minimal example controls a two-cylinder stepper motor using pneumatic valves which are controlled by controller pins 2 and 3.
 * A transistor (e.g. TIP120) can be used to switch a high-voltage (e.g. 24V) valve using controller's low-voltage logic signals (3.3V or 5V).
 * In this example the motor is configured to move 100 steps in forward direction, at a stepping frequency of two steps per second.
 * Example suitable stepper motors are the T-63, T-49 etc.
 * A two-cylinder stepper motor has two cylinders which are controlled in quadrature fashion. So the successive cylinder states are 00, 01, 11, 10, 00, 01, 11, 10 etc.
 * To use a three-cylinder stepper motor, use PneuAccelStepper::makeThreeCylinderAccelStepper(), or the more generic PneuAccelStepper constructor.
